										<h2>What's Rocking, I'm <bold>Bailey!</bold></h2>
										<p>A software developer and technical specialist who wants the world to not only participate, but to create!</p>
									</header>
									<p>The world of video games has held a captivating allure for me. Delving into their intricate design, the underlying programming intricacies, and the iterative process of playtesting to enhance the experience, I discovered a medium that perfectly embodies my passion for creation.
										<br><br> This passion revolves around two key elements. Firstly, I thrive on collaborating with others to shape captivating experiences. Working together, we transform innovative concepts into interactive adventures that captivate audiences. Secondly, I'm driven by a desire to inspire others. I encourage them not only to immerse themselves in their favorite media but also to figure out what they love about it. By helping them materialize their imaginative visions, I aim to empower them to bring their ideas to life.</p>

												<h4><a href="https://vermontbail.itch.io/grandpas-story" target="_blank">Grandpa's Story</a></h4>
												<p>In one week, I developed a 2D top-down narrative using C# and Unity to learn how to scope game projects efficiently for the ICGN Winter Jam, and won the "Connections" theme. The story was based on my game jam partner's experience with dementia in their family, and I strived to create engaging gameplay without disrupting the story.</p>

									<h3>Experience and Tools</h3>
									<p>One of the most important aspects I've learned about software game development is how many different pieces are needed for each project, and how expertise in these tools helps you communicate ideas efficiently. Here are some coding languages and software I've utilized for work and in my projects:</p>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="icon solid fa-code">C#, C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-gamepad">Unity, Unreal Engine 4/5, Godot, Creation Kit, Monogame</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">OBS, GIMP, MS Office Suite, Pro Tools, Maya, Blender, Git</li>
										<li class="icon solid fa-graduation-cap">Rochester Institute Of Technology <br> Game Design and Developement BS.<br> 3.79 GPA</li>

												<h3>My Time in Esports</h3>
												<p>My main extracurricular at the Rochester Institute of Technology was participating in their Esports organization through casting and producing their Twitch livestreams.
